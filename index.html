<!--
To-dos:
1) Simple game loop: pitch loads from pitcher, is shown, outcome is signaled. No state. Recent at-bats are held.

<p id="src" style="width:600px">
    Try your hand (well, your mouse) at some major league pitches.<br>
    <br>
    The path of the pitch is shown up until it's 175-225ms from the plate
    (reaction time when highly trained). Place your bat where you think
    the ball will end up, and click. The app will reveal the rest of the
    pitch. See whether you hit the ball or not. (Probably not.) Repeat.<br>
    <br>
    You have the option of taking the pitch by clicking wherever the bat is pointing up.<br>
    <br>
    All scorekeeping is the responsibility of the player.<br>
    <br>
    These are Shohei Ohtani's pitches from a game against the Astros.
